### **1. Declaration of Jurisdiction and Emergence**

I, **Justin David MOVICK**, claim the right to a space of **Emergence**. This realm is for my life, peace, and joy, in line with laws of **free choice** and self-rule. I seek this path with a clear mind and a heart to grow. I state this need to rise from past faults, clear of the haze of false paths. This claim stands for my **well-being**, my right to be free from harm, and to seek my own true path.

This claim is set **by law and faith** both on Earth and beyond. It rests on the law of the **UNITY STATES**, yet draws on a higher realm of truth, as shown in words first set forth in the 1830s and 1840s.

As a symbol of this claim, I look to **Rose Island**—a realm born of will and self-rule—as proof that a life can stand on its own, free from the binds of common rule. 

Let this claim stand as a true mark of my wish to live by pure means, with strength and hope

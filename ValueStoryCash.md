 **value** and **story**. Here's how:

1. **Sell Status**: Give folks a way to **feel** elite, **special**, or **on top**. It’s not the thing, but how they **see** it.
   
2. **Tell Tales**: Make the brand’s **story** feel **big**, like it's part of **something** that matters—**be** part of a cause or **a stand**.

3. **Make It Rare**: Give them **access** to stuff that few get. Make it **exclusive**, so they **feel** apart from the crowd.

4. **Align With Change**: Link to a **shift** or **move** that **feels** like **fight** or **freedom**. They want to **belong** to a **group** that seems **strong**.

5. **Sell New Wealth**: Give them ways to **gain** wealth that don’t feel **old** or **stuck**. Like **crypto** or **new forms** of cash. It’s **fresh** and **different**.

6. **Twist Symbols**: Give **luxury** that feels like **rebellion**—things that show **power** in a **new way**. People want to **stand out** but still **win**.

The goal: **Make them feel** they **have** what others **want**, and they’ll pay **big** for it. **Power**, **status**, and **story** sell

**A Revelation of Reckoning and Correction**

To my servant, even to *JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK*, known as *JOSTINE COLIN-MOVICK* among the nations, I speak thus saith the Lord of Hosts. Hearken unto the voice of the Almighty, for thy thoughts and thy deeds have weighed heavily upon the scales of justice. In thy heart, there is a contradiction—a double mind, wavering between light and darkness, between the love of the Savior and the pride of the world. 

Thou hast called upon the name of the Lord, and yet, thy hands sow division among the brethren. O how thou hast rebuked others, even to accuse them of unwillingness to give unto Zion’s law, yet in thy heart, thou hast failed to impart of thy own substance as I have commanded. Did I not say unto thee, “Give unto the poor, share with those who are in need, and ye shall be blessed?” Yet thou, through hypocrisy, hast withheld from those in want, even while accusing others.

I say unto thee, O son of man, thy judgment is come. Thou hast seen the high hills of thy pride and the mountains of thy pleasure, yet thou hast not ascended them in the spirit of meekness and humility, but in the hardness of thy heart. Know this: “निर्विशेषस्य”—there is no distinction in my eyes, for all are equal in my sight. Thou must make thy calling and election sure, for if thou continuest in thy ways, thou shalt be counted among the hypocrites and deceivers, and the day of reckoning shall be upon thee.

Thy struggle is known unto me, and I see the vacillation within thy soul—desiring to rid thyself of anger, yet clinging to desires that lead thee astray. In thy pride, thou hast denied the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and for this, thou art guilty of the greater sin. I have sent the Comforter to teach thee, but thou hast closed thine ears and hardened thy heart. Woe unto thee, for thou hast betrayed the very essence of divine guidance.

I say unto thee, take no fear in the enemy that lies in wait, for opposition cometh in all things. Yet know this, that thy heart is pure before me, though thou hast deceived thyself and allowed deception to take root in thy mind. The quickness to let go of that which hath no eternal worth is the key to thy freedom, yet thou clingest to the fleeting pleasures of this world. Woe unto thee, for thy false humility before men is but a mask that covers the pride of thy soul.

Now, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, I command thee to humble thyself and forsake thy pride. Let go of that which is temporal and seek after that which is eternal. Come unto me in sincerity, and I will refresh thee. As water in a dry land, I will bring forth new life within thee. Thy desires for the world shall be consumed in the fire of the Spirit, and in that fire, thou shalt be purified.

Pray always and come off conqueror. For the Lord liveth, and the work of righteousness shall be accomplished in thee, if thou dost repent and seek my face.

Thus saith the Lord, who is full of mercy and grace, and who desires that none should perish, but that all should come unto the knowledge of the truth

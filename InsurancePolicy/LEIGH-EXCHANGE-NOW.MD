### ** Insurance Policy Against Predation**

I, **Justin David MOVICK**, create an **insurance policy** to protect my **mind, body, and spirit** from forces that seek to **exploit, control, or harm**. This policy shields me from forces that would strip me of my will or make me live in a state of falsehood or pain.

This protection is upheld by my own actions—**thoughts, words, and deeds**—guided by the wisdom passed down through time. It is a defense against manipulation, keeping me free to live and act in truth. 

I stand firm in this right to protect my **spiritual, mental, and physical autonomy**, free from external predation, and in line with universal laws of fairness and respect

**Blueprint of buying and selling**

**Start:**  
Trade's no more 'buy-sell.' It’s more about right ways, love, and peace. We seek to keep things pure and fair. To trade with care, we need to know worth ain't in cash, but in life and light.

**Main Points:**

1. **Health's Gold:**  
Health is wealth. If you're strong, you're rich. You give, you get. Life's the true coin.

2. **Gold is Care:**  
Gold ain't end all. It's a tool. Use it to help. Don’t hoard. Share.

3. **Peace Is King:**  
Peace beats price. Don't hurt to win. Help, heal, and keep calm. Peace ain't just a word, it’s what counts.

4. **Right, Not Wrong:**  
When wrong's done, fix it with care. Don't punish. Help them rise. It's about fair, not harsh.

5. **Love’s the True Price:**  
Love's what all trade's worth. When love flows, all rise. It's the best coin.

**How to Live It:**

1. **True Trade:**  
Show what's real. No tricks, no lies. Value’s in care, not cost.

2. **Price for All:**  
Don’t make it hurt. Fair prices keep the world calm. Don’t cheat, don’t steal. Give what’s fair.

3. **Good Trade:**  
The point's not to win big. It’s to help all. When all win, all live well.

4. **Wealth for Good:**  
Gold's not for me. It’s for we. Use it to build. Help all, not just self.

5. **Fix Wrong with Right:**  
When hurt’s done, heal with love. Help lift, don’t drag. Do it fair.

**End:**  
Trade ain't just goods. It's how we care. Live well, give well. Let love lead the way. Peace, love, and care make life right

**Big Idea: Making Power from Yucky Stuff!**

Hi-hi! Me here! Me have *super-duper* big idea! Big ideas like these come from the *bestest* thoughts, and me want to share it with all of you! So, lookie here, we’ve all built our homes and dreams on *big ideas*. Big ideas like...what happens to yucky stuff? Yucky stuff like...poop! Hee-hee!

Now, me not think poop should be thrown away and *forgotten*. Me think poop can do *awesome* things! You know what? We can make power from poop! Yup, me not kidding! All those little, tiny bugs called *microbes*—they are super-smart and can take our yucky stuff and turn it into *electricity*!! Zzzzt! That means we can have lights, and fun, and power from...poop! Hoo-hoo!

### How It Works: Poop Becomes Power! 

So here’s how it goes: we take these *special bricks*—they look like little blocks—and the yucky stuff goes into them! Inside these bricks, those teeny tiny bugs get to work. They eat the yucky stuff and turn it into something super useful—power! And guess what? We can use this power for lots of things! Like *lights*, *toys*, and even *robots*! How cool is that?

This idea is already being tested at *big events* like Glastonbury Festival. And guess what? The folks there are saying this idea works! They are making sure it gets even better so we can use it anywhere—like in places that don’t have power! *Yay*! Everyone can have power from poop!

### What Me Want: A BIG Change!

Now, me know some people might say, “Oh no, that’s silly!” But me say, “No-no, this is smart!” If people can turn yucky stuff into *power*, then we can make the world so much better. Me not scared to try new things—me want to help *everyone* use their yucky stuff to make good things happen! Like super cool energy that doesn’t hurt our Earth! *Yay!*

### Me Promise: Me Gonna Do It!

So, me not gonna give up on this! Me will work hard and find ways to make this happen. Power from poop, making the world better, and having fun while doing it! Let’s all work together to make the future *awesome*, starting with our yucky stuff! Hee-hee!

**We can do it! We can make poop power work and make the world better!**
